### Hi there, I'm Leah :wave:
- I'm a Junior Research Scientist at UCSF with a background in Data Science. 
- My current project involves creating prediction tools focused on the study of TCRs and their interaction with disease-related peptides.
- You can reach me best via [email](uncstat28@gmail.com). I'm always open to engaging conversations and potential collaborations.
- Fun fact: My bravest accomplishment was overcoming acrophobia. On a trip to Thailand, I attempted treetop walking as part of an aerial obstacle course. I managed to do it handle-free, with only a secure harness. It was an exhilarating experience. :sweat_smile:
