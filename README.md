### Hi there, I'm Leah :wave:
- I'm a Data Science grad student at San Francisco State University.
- I'm best reached via [email](lung1@mail.sfsu.edu). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaborations.
- Fun fact: The bravest thing I've ever done is to overcome acrophobia. During a trip to Thailand, I tried treetop walking as part of an aerial obstacle course. I did it without handles but with a secure harness. It was a pretty cool experience. :sweat_smile:
